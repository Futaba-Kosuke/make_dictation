I'm very happy that you have decided to join us today.
It looks like everybody is here, so the meeting should go well and even finish early.
First of all, I would like to tell you all about the new personal vacation policy.
You may have up to five days off for personal reasons.
If you need more please ask your supervisor to let you take extra holidays.
You should be able to do this if someone can cover for you.
