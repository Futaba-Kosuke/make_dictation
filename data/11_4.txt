Because we are opening a new store, we will have a cut our costs for the upcoming year.
This will not be an easy thing to do, but it is necessary.
I suggest that 10% be cut from the advertising budget to help pay for the opening costs of the new store.
This shouldn't affect out profits because of our famous name.
If necessary, we can advertise more after it is open. I honestly believe this is the best thing to do right now.
