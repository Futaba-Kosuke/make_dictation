First, I would like to congratulate you on the work you've done so far.
When we all work together there is nothing we can't do.
Anyway, I called this meeting to announce the new personnel for this year.
Ms.Jenkins will join us as office manager.
Mr.Simmons will become the staff director, and Ms.Lee will become the sales director.
Please welcome them to our company and cooperate with them now and in the future.
